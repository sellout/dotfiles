Sellout’s general configuration

The non-personal bits of Sellout’s configuration, suitable for all to see.

This is missing pieces of Sellout’s actual configurations, such as

- account information,
- employer information,
- keys, and
- machine information.

Sellout’s actual system configurations depend on this repository and add some necessary pieces. But this has the bulk of their configuration to be able to share it and to get feedback.

## development environment

We recommend the following steps to make working in this repository as easy as possible.

### `direnv allow`

This command ensures that any work you do within this repository happens within a consistent reproducible environment. That environment provides various debugging tools, etc. When you leave this directory, you will leave that environment behind, so it doesn’t impact anything else on your system.

### `git config --local include.path ../.cache/git/config`

This will apply our repository-specific Git configuration to `git` commands run against this repository. It’s lightweight (you should definitely look at it before applying this command) – it does things like telling `git blame` to ignore formatting-only commits.

## building & development

Especially if you are unfamiliar with the nix ecosystem, there is a Nix build (both with and without a flake). If you are unfamiliar with Nix, [Nix adjacent](...) can help you get things working in the shortest time and least effort possible.

### if you have `nix` installed

`nix build` will build and test the project fully.

`nix develop` will put you into an environment where the traditional build tooling works. If you also have `direnv` installed, then you should automatically be in that environment when you're in a directory in this project.

## versioning

In the absolute, almost every change is a breaking change. This section describes how we mitigate that to offer minor updates and revisions.
